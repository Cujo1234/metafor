## Description

The `metafor` package is a comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abb√©, Baujat, GOSH plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time data, the package also provides functions that implement specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally, the package provides functionality for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.

## Installation

The current official (i.e., [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=metafor)) release can be installed directly within R with:
```r
install.packages("metafor")
```

After installing the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) package with ```install.packages("devtools")```, the development version of the metafor package can be installed with:
```r
library("devtools")
install_github("wviechtb/metafor")
```
This approach builds the package from source based on the development branch on GitHub. On Windows, [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) must be installed for this to work.
